I actually did not complete this project as a result of deadline task and alot of challenges
accrued during the process. Hence, i couldn't complete my tutorials because i was taking notes;
and jotting things down during the sessions.

It's meant to be an Authentication System am meant to
add deployment instructions here and (explain how it can be tested locally).
Hence, I'll also be reviewing it until completion.

I don't have my dashbord yet and haven't done some validations on the names and Email.
